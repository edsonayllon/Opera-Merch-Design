# Opera-Merch-Design

Cryptocurrencies are run by several computers agreeing by a consensus algorithm. This consensus algorithm is what allows these digital currencies to be decentralized. Consensus algorithms include:

- Proof of Work (Bitcoin)
- Proof of Stake (EOS and soon Ethereum)

This design expands on this concept with the phrase "Proof of Existence," where existence is proven when you see a human in person.

Alternative phrases, such as "proof of fashion" and "proof of clothing" can be used. This design mimics the "Proof of" phrasing many consensus algorithms use.
